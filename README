BackupTool (c) blaine booher
see: http://github.com/booherbg/backupTool

This tool takes a folder and deletes all but the N most recent files.
It is meant to be used with a continuous backup system...

By default it runs as a "dry run" with no deletions. Use -X to enable deletions.
By default it keeps recent 4 file. Use -n 10, for example, to save 10 files
By default it is interactive. Use -y to disable interactive mode

Good luck. python backupTool.py --help for more information.

The generateTestFiles.py tool will generate some random files to play around
with. 

Oh one more thing. By default it only deletes .bak files... to change this
edit the python script. I didn't feel comfortable having this as an argument.
Working with deletion anything feels dangerous.
